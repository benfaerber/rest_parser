# rest_parser

Parse [VSCode `.rest` files](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) and [Jetbrains `.http`](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html) files.

These are common files used to integrate API testing into IDEs. 
There are multiple similar tools out there and it can be tedious to switch over.
This library was created with the hope that people will be able to parse these files and convert them into better alternatives.
